About:

The app is a travel planner that will give you the weather and the days left for your travel, also a picture about the city.

Is working with 3 APIs, Geonames, Wheatherbit and Pixabay.

Dependdencies used:

Cors, Express, Git, Webpack, Babel, css-loader, mini-css, node-sass, sass-loader, style-loader, Jest.

Extra feature:

When the images API responds with an empty list of images, do another request using the country name from the Weather API as query string. This will ensure we have a relevant image for the location provided.

Run the app:

- npm install
- npm run build
- npm run start
